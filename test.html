    <p id="tribute-info">He was a professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Lagos. A very brilliant man who was also an activist who often used the court to ventilate his struggles. I call him the the iconoclastic consummate litigant.While some saw him as an irascible menace, others, particularly members of the Shagari administration saw his unending litigations against the government as a demonstration of his nuisance value. But there were others who saw his actions as a demonstration of his obsession for justice and fair play.</p>
